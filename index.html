        Rich, flaky and the perfect complement to your morning cup of coffee,
        the croissant is the quintessential French pastry. But how did the
        croissant come to be?
      </h3>
      <p class="mx-5 p-4 lh-lg">
        To celebrate National Croissant Day, we’re taking a deep dive into the
        history of the croissant, complete with input from ICE’s Director of
        Pastry Research & Development, Chef Jürgen David. Across various
        accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it originates
        from Austria as the kipferl. Made from a yeasted wheat dough, the
        kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state
        that the kipferl has been around as early as the 13th century, but many
        believe it may be even older. Popular myths attribute its invention as a
        celebration of the Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the
        crescent shape represented the moon on the Ottoman flag. “These stories
        are almost certainly untrue,” Austrian native Chef Jürgen says.
        Regardless of the kipferl’s origins, it would migrate to France later in
        the 19th century. In another common legend, Marie Antoinette is said to
        have introduced the kipferl to French court, homesick for foods from
        Austria. While it’s a romantic story, there are no historical records to
        back up this retelling. The earliest recorded introduction of the
        kipferl to France occurred in 1839, when Austrian artillery officer
        August Zang founded a Viennese bakery in Paris. Parisians fell in love
        with the kipferl (and with Viennese baking as a whole), and imitated the
        bread in their own shops. The name "croissant" also began appearing in
        historical record, referring to the crescent shape of the bread. In
        1915, Sylvain Claudius Goy recorded the first-known French version of
        the croissant recipe. Instead of brioche dough, as August Zang used, Goy
        transformed the recipe to use a laminated yeast dough. Lamination
        involves folding butter and dough to create thin, flaky layers of
        pastry. And thus, the iconic French pastry we know and love today was
        born.
